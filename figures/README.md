## Usage in Thesis

### Chapter 8: Simulation Validation

**Figure 8.1**: Simulation Environment
> "Figure 8.1 shows the Gazebo simulation environment with the differential drive robot model. The robot consists of a base platform (blue) with two driven wheels (black) and a front caster wheel for stability."

**Figure 8.2**: Robot Model Detail
> "Figure 8.2 presents a detailed view of the robot model during path execution, demonstrating the differential drive configuration."

## Caption Suggestions

**Figure 8.1**: 
```
Gazebo simulation environment showing the differential drive mobile robot 
with 0.8m × 0.6m base, 0.3m diameter wheels, and differential drive configuration.
```

**Figure 8.2**:
```
Robot model during path execution in the agricultural row pattern simulation.
The blue base platform houses the control system, with black driven wheels 
providing mobility.
```

## Additional Figures Needed (Optional)

If more figures are desired:
1. Extract frames from videos in `/videos/` directory
2. Use command: `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -ss HH:MM:SS -frames:v 1 output.png`
3. Add captions to this README
